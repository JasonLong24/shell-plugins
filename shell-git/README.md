## Features
> Simplified Prompt just includes the current branch. It changes the clean and dirty color. Note: Once you enable the simplified prompt in your bashrc/zshrc it will disable everything else.
### Branch
Branch tells you the current branch you are on

By Default
- Green -> Clean Branch
- Purple -> Dirty Branch

### Hash 
Hash tells you the current hash of HEAD

### Status 
Status uses `git status --porcelain` to tell you information about changes

### Status Simp
Status Simp tells you just removed and modified files but does not include untracked files

### Master
Tells you how far you are behind or ahead of master

### Blacklist
You can blacklist directories from using the prompt. Declare the blacklist like an array with the full path to the directory. i.e `BLACKLIST=( "/home/jason/<Dir1>" "/home/jason/<Dir2>" )`
